## Overview:
Many have tried, and failed, to predict the stock market. Market timing is viewed by many to be nearly impossible and for that reason it tends to be avoided. However, with a discplined approach to adding exposure (e.g., dollar cost averaging into equity exposure), a portfolio manager can reduce timing risk associate with a trade. So with the technical side answered (i.e., when to buy a stock), how do we answer the fundamental side (i.e., what stock to buy)? Well, equity research analysts will tell you that with proper fundamental analysis, you can calculate a company's intrinsic value and compare that to the current common stock market value. This can lead to the analyst publishing a buy, hold, or sell recommendation. While this is obvious a simplified and general overview of how an analyst publishes a recommendation, it begs the question: can we feed a model labeled fundamental data (i.e., can we tell our model what companies are buys or not buys) and have the model learn and make predictions about other companies? That would surely save us a lot of time.

With this project, I attempted just that. I fed many different machine learning algorythms (trees/forests, ensembles, boosting, etc.) labeled fundamental financial data in an attempmt to learn what contributes most to a buy rating. But no model is perfect so by what metric do we compare each model?

As the following
